## Project Overview

Welcome to the Healthcare Data Exploration and Visualization project! In this project, we delve into a comprehensive healthcare dataset using Excel, SQL and Tableau to uncover valuable insights. By exploring patient demographics, medical conditions, billing trends, and more, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. Through interactive visualizations and analysis, we showcase the power of data exploration and visualization in driving informed decision-making in the healthcare domain.
